		<p><strong>Bolivia</strong>, officially known as the <strong>Plurinational State of Bolivia</strong>, is a large country located in South America. It has a land area of 1,098,581 km<sup>2</sup>. The population, as of May 2025, is almost 12,560,000 (UN estimate). Its capital is not its largest city (Santa Cruz de la Sierra), or its center of operations (Nuestra Se√±ora de La Paz), but rather the city of Sucre. Sometimes known as 'The City of Four Names', it was founded by the Spaniard Conquistadors some time between 1538 and 1540 (conflicting sources).</p>
